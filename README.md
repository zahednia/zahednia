Hi, my name is Kourosh Zahednia and I’m 20 years old.

I got interested in programming when I was 14. At first, I worked with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and improved myself in that area. During technical high school, I did several projects and even wrote some code for my school’s website, which helped me gain good experience.

Later, I realized my main interest is back-end development. I started with small Python projects, but soon I decided to focus on one language and one stack more seriously, so I chose C#.

My projects and the courses I took helped me progress a lot. My first serious project was called **ITSoftware**, which I built using C# Windows Forms. The idea was to help an IT team in a company record and manage computer system details and perform regular checks based on a schedule.

After that, I improved the project so it wasn’t only about computers anymore and could store information about any equipment in the company. That’s when I moved from Windows Forms to a Web API to make it more modern and easier to expand. In the end, I redesigned it as a website, and after continuous development, it was deployed to production and is currently being used.

Right now, I’m still learning and improving in back-end development, and I’ve also started learning front-end so I can build clean and standard web services (based on Clean Architecture) and also create nice and practical UI using Next.js and React.

My goal is to build software that is efficient, simple, and also attractive.
